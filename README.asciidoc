kakoune-extra-filetypes
=======================

This repository is a collection of https://github.com/mawww/kakoune[Kakoune]
highlighters for file formats that are not supported out of the box.

Installation
------------

The following will deploy all the highlighters to
`/usr/local/share/kakoune-extra-filetypes/rc` by default:

```
# make install
```

Tweak the values of the `DESTDIR` and `PREFIX` variables according to your
needs, e.g.:

```
$ make DESTDIR=/tmp/test PREFIX=/usr
```

Usage
-----

If you've installed the extra highlighters through your distribution's
package manager, they might be stored in a directory other than the
default one (c.f. above).

Autoload
~~~~~~~~

The "autoload" method lets the editor load the entire collection.

If you don't have an `autoload` directory already, you'll need to
create it, and make sure all the builtin scripts (provided by the
https://github.com/mawww/kakoune[Kakoune] editor) are loaded:

```
$ mkdir -p "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-${HOME}/.config}"/kak/autoload
$ ln -s /usr/share/kak/rc "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-${HOME}/.config}"/kak/autoload
```

Note that your distribution might have installed the editor's scripts in
a directory that isn't `/usr/share/kak`, you'll have to modify this path
according if that's the case.

Now create an additional symbolic link in `autoload` that points at the
extra highlighters:

```
$ ln -s /usr/local/share/kakoune-extra-filetypes/rc "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-${HOME}/.config}"/kak/autoload
```

Individual loading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you don't want to create an `autoload` directory, you can load all the
highlighters with the following code (to append to your `kakrc` file):

```
evaluate-commands %sh{
    find "${kak_runtime}"/../kakoune-extra-filetypes/rc -type f -name \*\\.kak -exec printf 'source %s\n' '{}' \;
}
```

You can also individually pick which highlighters to load in your `kakrc`
file, with the `source` command:

```
source %val{runtime}/../kakoune-extra-filetypes/rc/â€¦
```
